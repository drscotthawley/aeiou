## How to use

This is a series of utility routines developed in support of multiple
projects within the [Harmonai](https://www.harmonai.org/) organization.
See individual documentation pages for more specific instructions on how
these can be used. Note that this is *research code*, so it’s a) in flux
and b) in need of improvements to documenation.
